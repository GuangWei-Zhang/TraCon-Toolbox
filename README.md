##Closed-loop feedback control

Based on various forms of behavior paradigm, optogenetic manipulation of neuronal activity has boosted our understanding of the functional architecture of the brain circuits. In the meantime, the rapid development in computer vision tremendously accelerate the automation of behavior analysis. However, a deeper understanding of the neuronal circuits often requires real-time and event-triggered interference, to generate a tighter correlation between neuronal activity and behavior performance, which is time-consuming and cast challenge towards experimenters that cause variation. Here we describe our Track-and-Control (TraCon) toolbox, a fully automatic system with real-time object detection and low latency closed-loop hardware feedback. We further demonstrate that the system can be applied in a broad spectrum of behavior tests in the neuroscience field, including open field, cross maze, Morris water maze, real-time place preference, social interaction, and looming-induced defensive behavior tests. TraCon toolbox proved to be an efficient and easy-to-use method, and highly flexible for extension. Moreover, the toolbox is open source and compatible accross OS platforms and each lab can easily integrate TraCon with their existing set up to achieve automation. And we hope TraCon toolbox would further accelerate our understanding of the functional architecture of the brain. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1.Python environment and OpenCV library for the object detection analysis.
2.Arduino for TTL pulse train generation.

This instruction would go through every detail you might need to know while install the TraCon toolbox.


### Intall Python

#### Windows Users
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to dive into the TraCon toolbox

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
